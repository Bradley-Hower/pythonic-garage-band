## Tests

### How do you run tests?

Run tests via `pytest`. To install, `pip install pytest`.

### Any tests of note?

The test included test Guitarist, Drummer, and Bassist classes for __str__, __repr__, instrument and solo methods. The aforemention classes are also tested for instantiation of musicians. Bands are saved within the Band class. Lastly, bands are validated as being instantiated, holding members, a name, and player solos.
